---------------------------------------------------
Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.10
cmake > 2.6
root

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to qsim>
make


It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in

macros/runexmaple.mac

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./qsim runexample.mac

Ensure that all macros include a /run/initialization command or else they will
not work. 

==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./qsim

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac


---------------------------------------------------

==== CLI User Commands ===========

Using the Geant4 CLI it is possible to pass commands to modify behavior
and utilize the vis.mac macro from the command line.
These are all visible from the menu on the left.


---------------------------------------------------

==== Operational Mode Switches ===

There are CLI User Commands that allow the user to change the stand design and
incident particle characteristics to test different configurations and 
experimental expectations. These commands must be passed before a visualization
macro is used or the initialization command have been passed.

Also needed are new options for the new cherenkov PMT design.
