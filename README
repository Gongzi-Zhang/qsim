---------------------------------------------------
Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.10
cmake > 2.6
root

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to qsim>
make


It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in

macros/runexmaple.mac

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./qsim runexample.mac

==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./qsim

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac


---------------------------------------------------

==== CLI User Commands ===========

Using the Geant4 CLI it is possible to pass commands to modify behavior.
These are all visible from the menu on the left.
Recently added though is a boolean switch between the old and new detector
constructions, fNewStand, which when set to true utilizes the new stand design.

Also needed are new boolean switches between the old and new cherenkov
detectors and a switch between cosmic and beam mode (changing large amounts
of geometry and taking out scintillators and lead and also changing particle gun
characteristics).
